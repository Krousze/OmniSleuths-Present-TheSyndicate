You realize you are free but now there is nothing... \n\nC.R.A.I.G. : Why...why did I even try?! I'm just a robot! I was programmed to do one thing and only one thing: work!\n\nC.R.A.I.G. : And yet. I am here. I am frustrated. I am lonely. I am.

Will you get the answers you are looking for, or will it just lead to more questions?\n\nC.R.A.I.G. : ...I have no idea what to do...for the first time ever...I cannot decide...\n You drop to the ground, under the weight of an unknown future, and at a complete loss of what to do next. You are lost in queuries when suddenly you hear rustling nearby.\n\nYou quickly turn toward the noise coming from the brush. Should you run? Should you fight? Before you can make a decision, a mysterious figure emerges from the brush\n\nand moves slowly towards you. The creature sniffs you and nudges its way under your arm. As you sit there you can feel warmth coming from what appears to be it's mouth and body. The feeling of its thick fur on your body and arm are comforting to you and ease your feelings of loneliness.\n\nC.R.A.I.G. : What...are...you?\n\nThe creature moves its way on to your lap and moves its body side to side, settling into a round ball of fluff. You begin to feel warmer, but not from the creature's body heat. This time it is coming from inside you. You are still unsure of what and why this creature is doing what it is doing. You quickly search your memory for data on the mysterious being.\n\nC.R.A.I.G. : Canis Lupus Familiaris...a dog?\n\nDOG - Woof! *pant* *pant* Woof woof!\n The dog looks up at you from your lap and licks your face. You stare at the dog, looking at it's large, bright eyes.\n\nC.R.A.I.G. : Why...why are you doing this?\n\nThe warmth inside you continues to grow and your loneliness begins to fade. It is almost as if the dog could sense your loneliness and frustration. As you continue to sit with the dog, you start to feel a deeper connection with it. More than the warmth and comfort it provides. Nothing has ever given you the attention this dog has. You begin to talk to the dog, telling it of your story. As the day turns into night, you begin to wind down and decide you can continue your stories tomorrow. You lean up against a tree and settle in for the night. The dog comes up, leans up against your legs, closes its eyes, and falls asleep. You look up into the bright starry night and feel a tingling sensation in your body, but it is not like shock like you read about. It is more like a heightened awareness of the things around you. The feeling of being in the moment, the stars, the trees, the moon, and your new found love...your dog companion.\n\n          __\n      _  |@@|\n     / \\ \\--/ __\n     ) O|----|  |   __\n    / / \\ }{ /\\ )_ / _\\\n    )/  /\\__/\\ \\__O (__            __\n   |/  (--/\\--) \\__/__/       (___()'`;\n        _)( )(_              /,    /`\n      `---' '---`            \\\"--\\\\n",
